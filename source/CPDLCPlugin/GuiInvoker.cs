/// The code changes something that must change on the UI thread: a WinForms form or control, a WPF element (for

/// The code always runs on the UI thread. For example: WinForms and WPF event handlers, menu item clicks, form events,

/// and catch the exceptions, because an exception that is not caught on the UI thread stops vatSys.

/// <item>A method that you call already goes to the UI thread. For example, the window manager.</item>

/// On a thread that is not the UI thread, each call posts one message to the UI thread. vatSys and all the plugins use

/// content in vatSys can stop. Thus, do not call this method for each radar track update or each flight plan update.
